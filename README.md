- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @UnDrachen
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning C/C++ programming
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning embedded software
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: I would like to say Twitter (X), but not sure...that is like my Dorian Grey's picture (there you can see the darkest side of me).
- âš¡ Fun fact: UnDrachen is my gamertag in some platforms and multiplayer games.
